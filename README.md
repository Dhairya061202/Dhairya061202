## 📚 Projects

### Project 1: personal portfolio
A personal portfolio website made using React is a dynamic, responsive, and modular web application that showcases an individual's skills, projects, and personal information. It features a home page with a professional introduction, an about section detailing the individual's background and experience, a skills section with categorized technical and soft skills, a project showcase with detailed descriptions and links, and a contact form for easy communication. React's component-based architecture, state management, and routing capabilities enable smooth navigation, efficient performance, and seamless updates without page reloads.
